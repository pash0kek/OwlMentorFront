<h1>OwlMentor - personal AI counselor for college and K-12 students.</h1> 

<h2>Problem:</h2>
Waiting in line to see a counselor is frustrating, especially when you need answers to simple questions. Sometimes, you even need to speak with multiple advisors for different topics like academic advice, financial aid, or dual enrollment. Worse, the advisors you need might be unavailable. Furthermore, counselors spend 60% of their time talking with students, where 70% of inbound inquiries are repeat questions, and counselors struggle to keep up. As a result, students often don't receive timely answers.
<h2>Solution:</h2>
Introducing AI.Counselor, an AI-powered chatbot designed for integration into a collegeâ€™s website or official app. Like Siri or Cortana, AI.Counselor can answer questions, schedule appointments, and direct users to resources. However, it is specifically trained to handle knowledge domains and use cases relevant to college environments, effectively replicating the interaction between a student and a counselor. By providing timely answers to everyday questions, AI.Counselor helps students while reducing the workload on counselors, thereby enhancing staff productivity. This tool enriches student engagement and support, creating a smarter, more connected campus experience that benefits both students and staff.
<h2>How it works:</h2>
Students simply ask the AI.Counselor for help or advice, and it responds like a real college counselor. It offers assistance with academic, career, and college readiness, anytime and anywhere.
<h2>Market potential:</h2>
The size of the worldwide EdTech SaaS market was estimated at USD 110.46 billion in 2021 and is anticipated to increase at a CAGR of 16.5 % from 2022 to 2027.
